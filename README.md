This is a simple setup for an Angular 1.x app.

Includes:
  - Angular
  - ui-router
  - Jasmine + Karma suit for tests
  - Bootstrap and Angular-Bootstrap
  - Folder structure for Services, Directives, etc.
  
  
This is an opinionated structure but you can and should change as it fits better for you and the design patterns you follow.


### Clone angular-seed

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git
cd angular-seed
```

If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git <your-project-name>
```
