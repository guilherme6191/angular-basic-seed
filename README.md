This is a simple setup for an Angular 1.x app.

Includes:
  - Angular
  - ui-router
  - Jasmine + Karma suit for tests
  - Bootstrap and Angular-Bootstrap
  - Folder structure for Services, Directives, etc.
  
  
This is an opinionated structure but you can and should change as it fits better for you and the design patterns you follow.
